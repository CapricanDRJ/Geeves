# Geeves
Channel, Role, and Afk management Discord bot designed for use during Hades' Star 5 day Whitestar events.

The icons directory will need to be uploaded to a discord that your Geeves sits on, or if you wish to make your own bot and use existing icons and references your bot can be invited to the icon repository discord. Discord bots can cross post emojis without nitro so long as they have the permission to use external emojis. Also note that the pictures are webp and are named as jpeg to get past the discord upload filter which otherwise rejects but also converts files to webp.
